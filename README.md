# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model-Python

Overview: Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn, targeting at-risk customers and key attrition factors.

Objective: Boost customer retention by forecasting churn probabilities and uncovering critical demographic and income-related predictors.

Action: Executed exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and feature engineering. Trained models with hyperparameter optimization and performed feature selection to enhance model accuracy.

Outcome: Detected a 16.07% churn rate, revealing higher attrition among educated, married, and middle-income segments. Delivered actionable insights for targeted retention strategies.

Key Skills: Python, EDA, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning, Predictive Modeling
